\subsection{For Researchers}
Our results inform future research in the area of merge conflict difficulties in the following ways:
\textbf{How developers approach merge conflicts}\\
We provide information about which measurable factors help software practitioners understand the difficulty of a merge conflict (i.e. Complexity of conflicting lines of code, Number of conflicting lines of code, Time to resolve a conflict).
