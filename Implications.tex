This paper provides a look at the way that software practitioners perceive the merge conflict resolution process and discusses the implications, from their perspectives. We break down the separate implications for researchers, tool builders, and managers as follows:

\subsection{For Researchers}
Our results inform future research in the area of merge conflict difficulties from the human perspective.
Our findings from \ref{artifact-based-factors} and \ref{knowledge-based-factors} show that researchers should focus on practitioners' knowledge gaps just as much as interpretation of code-centric metrics like code complexity and SLOC. \textit{Complexity of conflicting lines of code} (F1) and \textit{Your knowledge/expertise in the area of conflicting code} (F2) represent our top 2 factors in the initial difficulty assessment of a merge conflict and also illustrate the divide between common metrics and the knowledge needs of the humans performing the resolutions.
 
Our findings confirm that informativeness of commit messages (N8) moderately impacts practitioner perceptions, making it a helpful metric in understanding difficulty, but we also found that 7 other factors affect difficulty to a greater degree. This indicates that while commit message analysis is important, future research should focus on knowledge- and comprehension-based difficulties of  merge conflict resolutions.

We also highlight needs (N1-N9) and factors (F1-F9) which have no statistical differences across experience, project size, open/closed source, or role. Practitioners agree on unmet needs across all measured demographics, leaving opportunity for future research into human perception of merge conflict difficulty in these areas.

\todo{
Program comprehension is a major thing for merge conflicts, the focus on maintenance and bug-fixes have primarily been the focus of the ICPC conference. Perhaps more focus needs to be placed on code comprehension in regards to merge conflicts. 
}
 
%The intention of this paper is to provide an investigative platform for future work into how developers perceive difficulties related to merge conflict resolution. Notably, we have already seen work in the area of history exploration \cite{mihai_lenses}.

\subsection{For Tool Builders}
Tools should solve the targeted problem, but our results also suggest that they should solve the problem enable developers by addressing developer needs for more context and analysis during a conflict resolution. Mainstream tools should help find expertise in areas of conflicting code, as Costa et al. did with TIPMerge tool~\cite{CostaSarma}. Additionally, they should provide a report of the impact of the changes involved in the conflict and provide relevant details about the circumstances surrounding the conflict.

Tool builders should address history exploration at scale, specifically for those in integrator roles. Support for more advanced and more specific use cases is critical to supporting those who deal with larger and more frequent merge-related tasks.

\todo{Managers need to facilitate better paired resolutions/code reviews, code understanding is important, so pairing experienced devs with new devs might be helpful/expertise differences}

\subsection{For Managers}
Practitioners who solve merge conflicts find the merge conflict resolution process to be challenging due to a lack of information, lack of expertise, and a lack of code comprehensibility (N1-N3). This suggests that managers should encourage code reviews and paired conflict resolutions. Allowing better communication between different stakeholders allows domain experts to express concerns about impacts of changes, allows authors to understand the intentions of others' code changes, and allows developers to put the collective knowledge of the group to the task of finding the best resolution for the conflict.
