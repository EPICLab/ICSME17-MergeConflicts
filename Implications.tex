\subsection{For Researchers}
Our results inform future research in the area of merge conflict difficulties in the following ways:
\textbf{How developers approach merge conflicts}\\
We provide information about which measurable factors help software practitioners understand the difficulty of a merge conflict (i.e. \textit{Complexity of conflicting lines of code}, \textit{Number of conflicting lines of code}, \textit{Time to resolve a conflict}). This information allows researchers to compare these perceived difficulties to difficulties in practice and better understand which part of the process.
\subsection{For Tool Builders}
This study provides tool builders with a list of priorities for improvements.
