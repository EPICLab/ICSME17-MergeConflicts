\subsection{RQ2: What factors impact the difficulty of a conflict resolution?}\label{RQ2}

\todo{talk about resolution difficulties in interviews and how survey answer options were formed}

Our survey results show that three of the factors we investigated have an effect on the difficulty of the process of resolving merge conflicts: \textit{The amount of information you have about the conflicting code}, \textit{Your expertise in the area of code with the merge conflict}, and \textit{How easy it is to understand the code involved in the merge conflict}. 
Participants also rated the following factors, but were more controversial:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{How well tools present information in an understandable way}
	\item \textit{Trustworthiness of tools}
	\item \textit{Tool support for examining development history}
	\item \textit{Complexity of the project structure}
	\item \textit{Informativeness of commit messages}
	\item \textit{Changing assumptions within the code}
	\item \textit{Project culture}
\end{enumerate}
