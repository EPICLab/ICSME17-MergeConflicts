\textit{Knowledge Gap} & 4 & Practitioners lack the knowledge necessary to resolve a merge conflict\\
\textit{Shifting Assumptions	} & 3 & Code-based assumptions are different between two code versions\\
\textit{Dependency Hell} & 3 & References to external code other parts of the system make resolution more complicated\\
\textit{Commit Messages}	 & 3 & The impact of commit message content\\
\textit{Territorial Contributors} &	2 & Some contributors have perceived ownership over sections of code which must be respected\\
\textit{Legacy Code} & 1 & Old code where the original author is no longer accessible\\

\subsubsection{Interviews}

Our interviews resulted in 10 categories in this category, as shown in Table \ref{interview_tags_rq2}.


Our survey results show that three of the factors we investigated have an effect on the difficulty of the process of resolving merge conflicts: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{How easy it is to understand the code involved in the merge conflict}. 
\item \textit{Your expertise in the area of code with the merge conflict}
\item \textit{The amount of information you have about the conflicting code} 
\end{itemize}
Table \ref{survey_res_diffs} shows the survey result of each factor in this question.

No factor in this category had an average below 3.03, so there were no factors tested that have little to no effect on the difficulty of a merge conflict resolution.

Based on prior work stating the value of commit messages \cite{yamauchi2014clustering} \cite{hindle2009automatic} \cite{cortes2014automatically} \cite{hattori2008nature}, we expected \textit{Informativeness of commit messages} to have a larger impact on the difficulty of a merge conflict resolution. One possible explanation for this discrepancy between the literature and perceptions is that commit messages provide a good source of metadata for researchers mining software repositories, but they are often too short to provide a reliable source of insight to a software practitioner in need of information about the commit.
