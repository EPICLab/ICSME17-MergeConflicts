\subsubsection{RQ1}
Survey participants were asked...

\textbf{*** Complexity of conflicting lines of code is important***}

\textbf{***Knowledge or expertise in the area of conflicting code is important***}

\textbf{***Time to Resolve the conflict increased with Experience***}

\textbf{*** Non-functional changes don't matter to anybody ***}

\textbf{***How each demographic differs from the whole***}

\textbf{***Tool Trust. 42.1\% Trust their tools less than A Lot***}

When 121 participants of no particular role were asked how much they trust their merging, history exploration, and/or conflict resolution tools, 57.9\% of participants reported that they trusted these tools either A Lot or Completely. While this is a majority of developers, this still leaves a significant number of people (42.1\%) who trust their tools A Moderate Amount or A Little. While we found no previous work discussing the threshold for how much trust a user must have in a tool, it seems reasonable to postulate that users who cannot trust their tools A Lot or Completely will avoid relying on such tools or thoroughly check that the tools correctly performed their tasks.
