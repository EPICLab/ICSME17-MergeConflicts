\subsubsection{RQ3}
Survey participants were asked what kind of improvements they would like to see in their tools. Of the options extracted from interviews, Figure \ref{tool_needs_rank} shows the rankings of each factor based on its median value rated by developers at different experience levels.

\textbf{***Many of the results show a certain level of agreement across most experience levels. ***}

Though there is some variation, several of these factors are consistent across experience levels. For instance, every experience level considers "Better Usability" to be either 1st or 2nd priority, developers with more than 5 years of development experience rank "Better ways of exploring project history" as the 3rd priority, and 4 of 5 experience levels rank "Better transparency in tool functionality/operations" as 5th most important of 6 factors. 5 of 6 groups also showed little concern about improving terminology and its consistency across different tools.
Notably, more experienced developers agree that better ways of filtering out less relevant data is important

\textbf{***Usability is important***}

\textbf{***Most don't seem to care about terminology***}

\textbf{***Better graphical presentation  of information seems to mattter more for less experienced devs***}

\textbf{*** The most experienced groups want better wats to filter out less relevant information***}

\textbf{***People care less about the transparency in operations***}
