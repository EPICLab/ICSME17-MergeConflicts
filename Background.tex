\comment{***Distributed, parallel development in Branches. Git operations***}

Modern software development models account for the concurrent development of a project with the use of version control systems such as Git, Mercurial, SVN, and others. This model works by allowing developers to work on a single project by keeping copies of the project locally and syncing with a shared version when they have completed a change. However, there are problems with this model. For instance, syncing with the shared version of the code may not always result in the two versions merging automatically.

In this paper, we refer to merge conflicts, which we define as a scenario in software development in which two copies of the same codebase diverge in such a way that they cannot be automatically merged together, requiring human intervention to successfully merge back together. 

While we recognize that other types of conflicts exist in software projects (i.e. social conflicts), we focus on conflicts in code.
