\comment{***Mihai Lenses covers history***}

Similar to our paper, Codoban et al. seeks to evaluate developer understanding and usage of code history \cite{mihai_lenses}. Our results show that history exploration factors into the difficulty of a merge conflict a moderate amount (mean of 3.03 on a 5-point likert scale). Because of this, their findings apply to a subset of the merge conflict resolution process, so some of their conclusions such as tool limitations in usability and history visualization may contribute to our independent findings that some participants want better usability (mean of 3.43) and better graphical presentation of information (mean of 3.14) from their merge conflict resolution tools.
