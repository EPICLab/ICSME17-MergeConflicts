\todo{How Do Software Engineers Understand Code Changes? - An Exploratory Study in Industry}
Gousios et al. \cite{integrator_perspective} conduct a study in which they ask integrators to describe difficulties in maintaining their projects and code contributions. 
They showed that integrators have problems with their tools, have trouble with non-atomic changesets, and rank \textit{git knowledge} in the top 30\% of their list of biggest challenges. 
Gousios et al. additionally conducted a study into the challenges of the pull-based model from the perspective of contributors~\cite{gousios2016work}. 
They found that most challenges relate to code contribution, the tools and model used to contribute, and the social aspects of contributing (specifically highlighting merge conflicts).
These works focus on the collaborative processes that goes into contributing to open-source projects and operating as integrators within them, whereas we examine the issues inherent to merge conflicts and the tools built to support their resolution.

De Rosso et al. \cite{DeRosso2016} used StackOverflow to create a list of ``misfits'' to indicate certain problems with the Git workflow. 
They also create a tool, Gitless, to alleviate some of the pain involved in using Git.
However, their results indicate that solutions such as Gitless do not support the workflow of expert users.
Their results compliment our findings that show that current merge toolsets do not support large, complex merge conflicts, which experts users are more likely to be tasked with resolving.

Codoban et al.~\cite{Mihai_lenses} seek to evaluate developer understanding and usage of code history. Our results show that tool support during history exploration factors into the difficulty of a merge conflict a moderate amount (N10). This result independently verifies their findings that practitioners experience tool limitations in usability (I1) and history visualization (I4).
