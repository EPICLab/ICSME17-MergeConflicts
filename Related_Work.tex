Gousios et al. performed a similar study to ours, describing integrators' difficulties as they maintain their projects and merge in new code contributions \cite{Gousios_ICSE_2015}. Both their paper and ours seek to identify a set of difficulties and find that there are many sides of the problem. They showed that integrators also have problems with their tools, have trouble with non-atomic changesets, and even rank \textit{git knowledge} reasonably high on the list of biggest challenges (top 30\% of factors), mentioning that most contributors don't know how to solve a merge conflict. They also experience what our study refers to as \textit{Project Culture}, but from the perspective of creating a project's culture by coordinating development efforts, tactful pull request rejections, and maintaining the vision of the project in spite of differing opinions.

\comment{***Mihai Lenses covers history***}

Similar to our paper, Codoban et al. seeks to evaluate developer understanding and usage of code history \cite{mihai_lenses}. Our results show that history exploration factors into the difficulty of a merge conflict a moderate amount (mean of 3.03 on a 5-point likert scale). Because of this, their findings apply to a subset of the merge conflict resolution process, so some of their conclusions such as tool limitations in usability and history visualization may contribute to our independent findings that some participants want better usability (mean of 3.43) and better graphical presentation of information (mean of 3.14) from their merge conflict resolution tools.
