When a merge conflict occurs, a developer must investigate the root cause, contributing factors, resources for resolution, plan of action, and any potential after-effects in order to effectively mitigate the conflicting code.
Tool builders and researchers have previously focused on preventing and resolving merge conflicts, but there is little empirical knowledge about how developers rationalize  the merge conflict resolution process.

In this paper, we present an in-depth empirical study of how developers perceive (1) approaching merge conflicts, (2) what factors impact the difficulty of a merge conflict resolution, and (3) what toolset changes should be made to improve the resolution process.
To learn more about these perceptions, we interviewed 10 experienced developers, then extended our findings with a survey of 226 developers.
We provide personal accounts of experiences in resolving merge conflicts and contribute ranked lists of: factors that developers perceive as difficult in their initial estimates of a merge conflict, factors that cause difficulty for developers, and tool needs for merge conflict resolution.
