When a merge conflict occurs, a developer must investigate the root cause, contributing factors, resources for resolution, plan of action, and any potential after-effects in order to effectively mitigate the conflicting code.
Tool builders and researchers have previously focused on preventing and resolving merge conflicts, but there is little empirical knowledge about how developers rationalize about a conflict while working to resolve it.

In this paper, we present an in-depth empirical study of how developers perceive (1) how to approach merge conflicts, (2) what factors impact the difficulty of a merge conflict resolution, and (3) what toolset changes should be made to improve the resolution process.
To learn more about these perceptions, we interviewed 10 experienced developers, then extended our findings with a survey of 226 developers. We further divided these developers by gender, developer role, experience, source distribution model, and project size.
Our findings suggest that developers have several universal difficulties that cross all demographics, that...
