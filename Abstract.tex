Software development requires collaboration. The most popular way to collaborate on software is through a version control system; however, one difficulty of these collaboration efforts is merge conflicts. Merge conflicts can interrupt a developer's workflow and introduce bugs. While some problems may be universally experienced, it is also important to recognize that different subsets of software developers do not experience difficulties in the same ways. This study seeks to identify common difficulties and how different kinds of developers compare in terms of their difficulties.
