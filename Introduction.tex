\todo{Do we want to cite Caius/Iftekhar paper?}
Version control systems like Git offer easier collaboration via an automated merging process. This process enables large-scale distributed development, but as sophisticated as these tools are, they still require manual merging in ambiguous cases called merge conflicts. Sarma et al \cite{cassandra} shows that merge conflicts are as frequent as 19\% of merges, and Brindescu \& Ahmed et al (maybe) shows that [\% of merges that are conflicts] of merges result in conflict. Resolving merge conflicts can be a costly process that delays projects while developers decide how to approach and resolve the conflict \cite{cassandra}, and poorly-performed merge conflict resolutions frequently cause integration errors \cite{bird-branches-conflict}.

\comment{***current work on proactive detection***}

Several studies have examined models for proactive merge detection and prevention~\cite{Brun2011}\cite{palantir}\cite{Guimaraes}, proposed tools and systems for efficiently avoiding or resolving merge conflicts~\cite{nishimura}\cite{mens2002state}, or discussed advantages of syntax- and semantic-aware merges \cite{danny_refactorings}\cite{hunt2002extensible}. However, at some point in a software projects' development history, there is the chance that a merge conflict will still occur. 

\comment{***we need to know more about conflicts because...***}

Despite the focus in this area, few studies have actually talked to developers to understand their perceptions about merge conflicts. Talking directly to developers is crucial to understanding their problems from their perspectives, since some details of merge conflict resolution cannot be observed by mining a GitHub repository. 

Our research questions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{RQ1:} How do developers approach merge conflicts?\\
\item\textbf{RQ2:} What factors impact the difficulty of a conflict resolution?\\
\item\textbf{RQ3:} Do developer tools meet developer needs for merge conflicts?\\
\end{itemize}

In this study, we investigate these research questions with an interview of 10 developers and a survey of 226 software practitioners and found 9 factors that developers use to assess the , a ranked list of tool needs for merge conflict resolution, and personal accounts of experiences in resolving merge conflicts.
