\section{Introduction}
\textbf{***distributed development process***}

\textbf{***Conflicts occur and often****}

Version control systems like Git offer easier collaboration via an automated merging process. This process enables large-scale distributed development, but as sophisticated as these tools are, they still require manual merging in ambiguous cases called merge conflicts. As a conference presenter by the name of Corey Quinn has stated in one of his recurring talks entitled \textit{Terrible Ideas in Git}, "A group of whales is a pod, a group of ravens is a murder, and a group of programmers is called a merge conflict" [Terrible Ideas in Git]. Resolving merge conflicts can be a costly process that delays projects while developers decide how to approach and resolve the conflict \cite{cassandra}. 

\textbf{***current work on proactive detection***}

Many studies have suggested ways of proactively detecting and avoiding conflict \cite{Brun2011} \cite{palantir} \textbf{***WRITE MORE about the stuff that exists there***}

\textbf{***we need to know more about conflicts because...***}

However, few have actually talked to developers to understand their perceptions about merge conflicts. Talking directly to developers is important for understanding their problems from their perspectives. 

\textbf{***This going to make the paper or break it ? refer to Danny/Mihai paper (lenses)***}

Our research questions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{RQ1:} What kind of factors cause a merge conflict to be perceived as difficult?\\
\item\textbf{RQ2:} What kinds of difficulties do developers face when trying to resolve a merge conflict?\\
\item\textbf{RQ3:} What kinds of tool difficulties do developers face when trying to resolve a merge conflict?\\
\item\textbf{RQ4:} How does demographic change which difficulties are most impactful?\\
\end{itemize}
