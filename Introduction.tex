Version control systems like Git offer easier collaboration via an automated merging process. This process enables large-scale distributed development, but as sophisticated as these tools are, they still require manual merging in ambiguous cases called merge conflicts. Merge conflicts are frequent, as shown Sarma et al [\% of merges that are conflicts] and Brindescu \& Ahmed et al (maybe) [\% of merges that are conflicts]. Resolving merge conflicts can be a costly process that delays projects while developers decide how to approach and resolve the conflict \cite{cassandra}, and poorly-performed merge conflict resolutions frequently cause integration errors \cite{bird-branches-conflict}. 

\comment{\textbf{***current work on proactive detection***}}

Many studies have suggested ways of proactively detecting and avoiding conflict \cite{Brun2011} \cite{palantir} \comment{\textbf{***WRITE MORE about the stuff that exists there***}}

\comment{\textbf{***we need to know more about conflicts because...***}}

However, few have actually talked to developers to understand their perceptions about merge conflicts. Talking directly to developers is important for understanding their problems from their perspectives.

\textbf{***This going to make the paper or break it ? refer to Danny/Mihai paper (lenses)***}

Our research questions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{RQ1:} What kind of factors cause a merge conflict to be perceived as difficult?\\
\item\textbf{RQ2:} What kinds of difficulties do developers face when trying to resolve a merge conflict?\\
\item\textbf{RQ3:} What kinds of tool difficulties do developers face when trying to resolve a merge conflict?\\
\item\textbf{RQ4:} How does demographic change which difficulties are most impactful?\\
\end{itemize}
