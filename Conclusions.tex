\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
Merge conflicts interrupt. 
Our work explores the human perceptions of merge conflict resolution in version control systems. We conducted an analysis of 10 interviews and confirmed our findings with a survey of 162 practitioners.

We asked how practitioners approach merge conflicts and found that they identify 8 factors of importance for the initial evaluation of merge conflict difficulty. 
We then asked which factors impact the difficulty of a merge conflict resolution and found 10 factors that impact the difficulty of the merge conflict resolution process. 
These sets of factors serve as a way to inform managers and future research about merge-conflict-related difficulties of software practitioners.

We also asked if developer tools met practitioner needs for merge conflict resolutions and found 6 improvements which practitioners would like to see in these tools. 
In addition, we share specific tool needs from our interviews to give an idea of what people really struggle with in their merge conflict resolution workflows.

Essentially, this paper contributes an empirical study that can act as a basis for reasoning and further investigation about merge conflicts' perceived difficulties and the support that practitioners are getting from tool builders.
